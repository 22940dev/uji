# uji

*TODO summary*

TODO the interface is designed(or rather, deliberately not designed) for exploration through play â€“ both for you, as the user, and me, as the person who made the weird-ass interface. maybe link to place where/if i strung together development screenshots/states

TODO if you find that changing one slider slightly modifies some behavior you'd expect to be the domain of other sliders: let's just say that's a constraint designed to send your creative mind down fresh paths (and not lazy implementation details).

TODO some demo images or gif/video
