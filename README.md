# uji

*A minimalist generative art thing – play with the sliders and press the buttons.*

TODO the interface is designed(or rather, deliberately not designed) for exploration through play – both for you, as the user, and me, as the person who made the weird-ass interface. maybe link to place where/if i strung together development screenshots/states

TODO meditative, just play with the sliders etc.

TODO if you find that changing one slider slightly modifies some behavior you'd expect to be the domain of other sliders: let's just say that's a constraint designed to send your creative mind down fresh paths (and not lazy implementation details).

TODO some demo images or gif/video

TODO name: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uji_(Being-Time), but really something i made in brachiosaurus (https://github.com/doersino/brachiosaurus/blob/24fb60c86e037053ed1003a356a7ca1d8135c5fd/examples.py#L413) and later made the logo of this tool using mddb

## Things I wanted to add but didn't because I would've gotten bored of it and never released this thing

Perhaps I'll revisit this list at some point if motivation strikes.

* More shapes and options, of course.
* + and - working when hovering over slider to increment value, with shift for 10x change
* history: keep current action along with last value, etc.?
* keep option values in local storage and load them if no url hash given (if is given or if nothing in local storage, only write to it on slider changes or preset selection)
* maybe use Navigator.share() instead of deprecated copying thing in sharing, also twitter etc. buttons
* webgl rendering (although blend modes and blurring might not be so easy there?)


known bugs: chrome often less distinct/clear/bright lines than other browsers
