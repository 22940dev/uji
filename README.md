# UJI

*A minimalist generative art thing â€“ press the buttons and play with the sliders.*

The interface is designed (or, rather, deliberately *not designed*) for **exploration through play** â€“ both for you, as the user, and me, as the person who made the weird-ass interface. It's intended to facilitate a somewhat meditative and creative environment.

The **tiled buttons at the top are presets** â€“ use them as jumping-off points, or click your way through them to see what's possible before starting afresh by yourself. The "âŒ˜" preset has all options set to their defaults, so it's a good starting point once you've played around a bit.

#### [ðŸŽ¨ Play around with the various options at `doersino.github.io/uji/`!](https://doersino.github.io/uji/)

Hover over the icons (which feature glyphs from [Imperial Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Aramaic#Unicode) and [Phoenician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet#Unicode)) for descriptions of what each slider does. If you find that changing a slider slightly modifies some behavior you'd expect to be the domain of other sliders: Let's just say that's a constraint designed to send your creativity down fresh paths (and not lazy implementation details).

*Regarding the name:* I could pretend that it's referring to the concept of [*uji* in Zen Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uji_(Being-Time)), but really, the letters just lend themselves to a pretty logo, an [initial iteration](https://github.com/doersino/brachiosaurus/blob/24fb60c86e037053ed1003a356a7ca1d8135c5fd/examples.py#L413) of which I cobbled together with my pen plotting tool [Brachiosaurus](https://github.com/doersino/brachiosaurus/) and later made the [final logo](https://gist.github.com/doersino/c2c4e3f110b75ac8eef3b46a8ee30d36) using the [Markdeep Diagram Drafting Board](https://github.com/doersino/markdeep-diagram-drafting-board).


## Notes

### Setup

It's just some HTML, JavaScript, an image, and a few webfonts â€“ so no setup is required! If you want to run this tool locally, simply `git clone` this repository or [download a ZIP](https://github.com/doersino/uji/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), then open `index.html` in your favorite browser. Of course, link sharing doesn't make a whole lot of sense in that context, the rest should work just fine.


### Features I wanted to add but didn't because I would've gotten bored of it and never released this thing in the first place

Perhaps I'll revisit this list at some point if motivation strikes.

* More shapes and options, of course.
* Allowing fine-grained adjustment of the options via keyboard shortcuts â€“ when hovering over a slider, press <kbd>+</kbd> or <kbd>-</kbd> to increment and decrement its value according to its `step` attribute, perhaps with <kbd>shift</kbd> for a 10Ã— larger change.
* Maintaining an *undo*/*redo* history. I think keeping the *current* action along with the *last* instance of `optionValues` should suffice? If a user keeps adjusting the same value, the history would stay constant, then. The thinking needs to a be a bit more fleshed out than this, though.
* Keeping option values in local storage and restoring them on load if no URL hash present.
* WebGL rendering (although blend modes and blurring might not be so easy there).
* The possibility to export the result as a minimal JavaScript file with all `opts.*` references in the render loop substituted? That might help folks adapt their results for, say, pen plotting.
* Video export, see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19235286/convert-html5-canvas-sequence-to-a-video-file/62065826#62065826).
* TODO allow user to draw line?


### Known bugs

Chrome tends to draw less distinct/clear/bright lines than other browsers.
