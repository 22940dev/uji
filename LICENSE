* The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all

* The Software shall not be used to generate art intended for distribution as
a non-fungible token ("NFT"). Current implementations of NFTs are inherently
destructive to the environment and carry little to no practical benefit over
conventional means of recording provenance and/or ownership due to the inherent
limitations of any contract â€“ smart, non-fungible, or ink on paper.

* The previous point may be disregarded if the revenue generated by any relevant
NFTs is wholly spent on bird seed, and said bird seed is dispersed around the
local area for the resident birds to feed on, and pictures of said feeding are
provided to the copyright holder noted above (the "pics or it didn't happen,
also birbs are cute" clause).

If any rule of this agreement should be or become inoperative, validity of the
other rules is not affected. The parties will care about replacing the invalid
rule by some valid rule that comes close to the purpose of this agreement.
